Why do we have to take a bath every day?
Taking a bath is like giving our bodies a fresh start every day! Imagine if your favorite toy never got washed—it would get sticky and smelly! Our bodies are the same. When we play, run, and explore, we collect dirt and germs. Bathing keeps us clean, fresh, and healthy, so we feel great and smell nice too!

Why can’t we eat candy all the time?
Eating candy is fun, but too much can make our teeth sad and our bodies tired! Our bodies need healthy foods like fruits, veggies, and proteins to grow strong and have lots of energy just like a superhero needs the right fuel! Candy is a special treat, but eating too much can make us feel sick. So, we enjoy it sometimes, but we also eat good foods to stay happy and strong!
